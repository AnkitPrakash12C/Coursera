# GPU-Accelerated Sobel Edge Detection

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a high-performance implementation of the Sobel Edge Detection algorithm using CUDA. It compares the execution time of a GPU kernel against a standard CPU implementation on large 2D data arrays.

## Requirements
* NVIDIA GPU (SM 3.0+)
* CUDA Toolkit (10.0+)
* GCC Compiler
* Make

## Compilation
To compile the project, simply run:
```bash
make clean build
